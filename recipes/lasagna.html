    <h3>Recipe</h3>

    <p>
        To prepare lasagna from scratch, you start by making sauce, then layer it with wide, flat lasagna noodles and cheese before baking. 
        The sauces can vary from tomato-based sauce, with or without meat, to creamy bechamel sauce, which works well with a wide variety of vegetables.
    </p>
    <p>
        The basic building formula for lasagna is sauce, noodles, more sauce, then cheese. 
        Repeat the noodle-sauce-cheese order until the pan is nearly filled, then end with sauce and cheese on top.
    </p>
    <p>
        Both tomato and cream-based sauces for lasagna can be made and refrigerated for up to 3 days before assembling the lasagna. 
        Once baked, the lasagna can be refrigerated for up to 4 days. To freeze, bake 30 minutes but do not brown, then cool, and freeze for up to 4 weeks. 
        We do not recommend assembling and refrigerating or freezing an unbaked lasagna. This will adversely affect the texture.
    </p>
    <p>
        To reheat frozen lasagna, defrost, then sprinkle with mozzarella and bake uncovered at 400 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes until golden brown and bubbling on the surface. 
        Refrigerated lasagna also can be reheated in a 400-degree oven until heated through. 
        Chilled small individual servings can be microwaved.
