    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <p>
        — The key ingredient to birria. José uses a mix of dried chiles to provide the flavor backbone of the dish, while also achieving the dark red color that birria is known for; however, 
        despite being packed with chiles, José says a classic birria shouldn’t be spicy. 
        You can see that through his choice of the central chile in his birria: “The base of my birria is guajillos. 
        You cannot make birria without guajillos.” Guajillos are one of the most popular and commonly used chile in Mexican cuisine and provide an earthy, 
        sweet flavor that does well to supplement other tastes and types of chiles. 
        José supplements the mild flavor of guajillos with some moritas—jalapeños that have been smoked and dried. 
        They add a bit of smokiness and heat that really add to the birria's complexity.
        — Low and slow is the way to go. José braises his birria for hours. 
        This long cook time is absolutely necessary to break down and tenderize the brisket while also leaching the beef bones of all their flavor. 
        I know it may seem laborious, but the reality is once you’ve gotten everything in the pot and have put it in your oven, you have 4 to 5 hours to do whatever you like!

    <h4>Serving ideas for birria</h4>
    <p>
        While birria can be served in countless ways, from tacos to mulitas (to even ramen!), 
        we love making quesatacos stained red with the fat of the birria and seared until almost crispy. 
        The queso oaxaca melts and creates what is essentially a mini quesadilla, ready to be dunked into bowls of consomé. 
        Half the joy of eating birria is absolutely drowning whatever you've stuffed with your 
        brisket and short rib into the flavorful broth, so no matter your serving method, do not forget the generous side of consomé.
